# Minimal example on how to use pandas with a MySql database

For this example to work crossplatform it uses [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) to run the MySql database. Install Docker and run the following command in this directory to start the database server. 

`docker-compose up -d`

For the code to run you have to install the dependencies, simply run:

`pip install -r requrements.txt`

After that you can start jupyter-lab to play with the example, by running:

`jupyter lab`
